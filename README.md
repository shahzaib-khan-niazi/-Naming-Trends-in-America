# Trendy Names: Analyzing Baby Name Trends in the US

This project explores **US baby name trends** using Python, pandas, and Matplotlib. It uncovers **rising and falling names, decade-based popularity, regionally unique names, gender distribution, and comeback names** using real Kaggle datasets.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Visualizes name popularity trends over time (line plots).  
✅ Linear regression trend modeling.  
✅ Compares state-wise popularity (e.g., CA vs TX).  
✅ Identifies top names by decade and year.  
✅ Detects rising, falling, and potential comeback names.  
✅ Analyzes gender distribution for unisex names.  
✅ Shows regional uniqueness scores.  
✅ Displays top 10 most popular names across all years.

## 📊 Datasets

- `NationalNames.csv`: National-level baby name data (year, gender, count).
- `StateNames.csv`: State-level baby name data (state, year, gender, count).

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (LinearRegression)

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Names like **Emma, Isabella** show clear rise-and-fall popularity patterns.
- Identified top rising and falling names by comparing the 1990s vs 2010s.
- Detected **regionally unique names** that are highly popular in fewer states.
- Found **comeback names** using polynomial trend detection.
- Gender-neutral names like **Taylor** show interesting gender splits over time.

## 🖥️ How to Run

1️⃣ Clone this repository.  
2️⃣ Place `NationalNames.csv` and `StateNames.csv` in the project folder.  
3️⃣ Run the Python script in your IDE or Jupyter Notebook.  
4️⃣ Visualizations will display interactively for exploration.

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

- Convert into an **interactive Streamlit or Tkinter dashboard** for user-driven exploration.
